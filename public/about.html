<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jibril Muhammad. I am a computer science student in Bayero University, Kano,
   Nigera, and i am currently about to enter my third year. I am also an aspiring web developer 
   who is currently in the process of putting in the work and time required to become one.</p>

<p>I am currently 20 years old and i think this is a stage which time
   shouldn't be wasted on unproductive things.</p>

<p>I am still learning and still in my early stages so hopefully y'all
   will see my works in the nearest future my the grace of Allaah. </p>
